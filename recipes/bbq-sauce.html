    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This recipe uses a lot of apple cider vinegar, so isn't as sweet as your regular 
        store-bought BBQ sauce. The ingredients listed are the baseline, however you're free 
        to add extras of anything listed to enhance certain flavors. I tend to do it every time 
        because the sauce never comes out the same way twice for me.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 28 oz can (3.5 cups) tomato puree (or tomato sauce)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tbsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp hot sauce, or to taste</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine tomato puree, apple cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce in a pot over 
         medium heat.</li>
         <li>Stir in remaining ingredients.</li>
         <li>Bring to a boil, then lower heat and let simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
         <li>Taste, and add incredients if necessary; brown sugar for more sweet, vinegar for 
          more tang, hot sauce for more spice. Try to refrain from adding any more tomato paste
          or Worcestershire sauce. With these two ingredients, a little goes a long way and can
          change the sauce more than is intended.</li>
      </ol>
