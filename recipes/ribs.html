      <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe is designed to give you <em>fall-off-the-bone</em> ribs every single time, 
          while also teaching you some tweaks that you can make depending on your preferences. 
          You'll be using the traditional <strong>3-2-1 method</strong>, smoking <em>low and slow</em> 
          at anywhere from 225-250 degrees for a total of roughly 6 hours. The <strong>3-2-1 method</strong>
          goes like this: 3 hours unwrapped on the rack, 2 hours wrapped in butcher paper, then 1 hour
          unwrapped with sauce.</p>

        <p>Within that structure some things can change, starting with your choice of rib. <strong>Baby
          Back</strong> ribs are meatier and jucier, often requiring a slightly longer cook time.
          The longer cook makes that 2-hour section all the more important, where we'll reintroduce some
          moisture to the meat. <strong>St. Louis</strong> ribs are a flatter and thinner (but also fattier) 
          cut and are better suited to the fall-off-the-bone style that people look for. The extra fat also
          gives us some wiggle room with lost moisture while smoking, and are more accomodating to quicker cooks.
          The final hour with sauce is optional depending on whether or not you like to keep your ribs
          dry-rub only. If that's the case, after pulling from the butcher paper look at the bones. If they're
          sticking out an inch or so, the ribs are done and ready to serve.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 rack of St. Louis or Baby Back ribs</li>
          <li>Your favorite BBQ rub (or use our <a href="../recipes/bbq-rub.html">BBQ Rub</a>)</li>
          <li>Butcher paper (you can use aluminum foil, but butcher paper is much better)</li>
          <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
          <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
          <li><em>(optional)</em> Your favorite BBQ sauce (or use our <a href="../recipes/bbq-sauce.html">
          Vinegary BBQ Sauce</a>)</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Take the ribs out of the fridge, making sure they reach room temperature before cooking.</li>
          <li>
            Preheat your smoker to 225-250 degrees, using your favorite smoking wood.
            <ul>
              <li>I prefer Apple or Cherry for ribs, depeding on the sauce you're using. Apple goes best
                with more vinegary sauces, while Cherry works best with sweeter sauces/rubs.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Pat the ribs dry with a paper towel</li>
          <li>On the underside of the rib, use the sharp point of a knife to remove the membrane (this 
            may already have been removed)</li>
          <li>Generously coat the ribs on both sides with the rub.</li>
          <li>Add ribs to the smoker and let sit for 3 hours, monitoring temperature and wood as usual.</li>
          <li>Remove ribs from the smoker and wrap in butcher paper, following the instructions below, then
            place back on the smoker for 2 hours.
            <ul>
              <li>Before wrapping the ribs, spread the 1/4 cup of brown sugar flat on the butcher paper.</li>
              <li>Cut the 1 tbsp of butter into 3-4 pieces and distribute on top of the brown sugar</li>
              <li>Place the ribs on top of the butter, top-side down (bone side up)</li>
              <li>Wrap (there are many videos on how to wrap properly if this is your first time)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Remove ribs from the wrap, and brush sauce on both sides. Place back on smoker for 1 hour.
            <ul>
              <li>If ribs look done after removing from the wrap, you can cut this step down to 30 minutes, 
                giving just enough time for the sauce to really adhere to the meat and turn into a glaze.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Slice and serve, using the sharpest knife you have to ensure the meat doesn't fall off the bone
            while slicing.</li>
        </ol>
