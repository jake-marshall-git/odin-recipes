    <h1>BBQ Smoked Ribs</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This recipe is designed to give you <em>fall-off-the-bone</em> ribs every single time, 
        while also teaching you some tweaks that you can make depending on your preferences. 
        You'll be using the traditional <strong>3-2-1 method</strong>, smoking <em>low and slow</em> 
        at anywhere from 225-250 degrees for a total of roughly 6 hours. The <strong>3-2-1 method</strong>
        goes like this: 3 hours unwrapped on the rack, 2 hours wrapped in butcher paper, then 1 hour
        unwrapped with sauce.</p>

      <p>Within that structure some things can change, starting with your choice of rib. <strong>Baby
        Back ribs</strong> are meatier and jucier, often requiring a slightly longer cook time.
        The longer cook makes that 2-hour section all the more important, where we'll reintroduce some
        moisture to the meat. <strong>St. Louis ribs</strong> are a flatter and thinner (but also fattier) 
        cut and are better suited to the fall-off-the-bone style that people look for. The extra fat also
        gives us some wiggle room with lost moisture while smoking, and are more accomodating to quicker cooks.
        The final hour with sauce is optional depending on whether or not you like to keep your ribs
        dry-rub only. If that's the case, after pulling from the butcher paper look at the bones. If they're
        sticking out an inch or so, the ribs are done and ready to serve.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 rack of St. Louis or Baby Back ribs</li>
        <li>Your favorite BBQ rub (or use <a href="../recipes/bbq-rub.html">our BBQ rub</a>)</li>
        <li>butcher paper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li><em>(optional)</em> Your favorite BBQ sauce (or use <a href="../recipes/bbq-sauce.html">
          our BBQ sauce</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Take the ribs out of the fridge, making sure they reach room temperature before cooking.</li>
        <li>
          Preheat your smoker to 225-250 degrees, using your favorite smoking wood.
          <ul>
            <li>I prefer Apple or Cherry for ribs, depeding on the sauce you're using. Apple goes best
              with more vinegary sauces, while Cherry works best with sweeter sauces/rubs.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Pat the ribs dry with a paper towel</li>
        <li>On the underside of the rib, use the sharp point of a knife to remove the membrane (this 
          may already have been removed)</li>
        <li>Generously coat the ribs on both sides with the rub.</li>
        <li></li>
      </ol>
